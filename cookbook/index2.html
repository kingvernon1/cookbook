            <p Recipe Preparation </p> <h3>Recipe Preparation
              Place salt and brown sugar in a medium bowl and work together with your fingers until incorporated. Place turkey on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. (If you don't have this setup, place your turkey on a V-shape rack set
              inside a large roasting pan.) Sprinkle dry brine all over outside and inside of turkey, patting to adhere and nudging some into crevices. You won't need all of the dry brine, but it’s good to have extra since some of it will end up on
              the baking sheet as you season the turkey. Chill bird, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.
              Remove turkey from wire rack and rinse baking sheet and rack if needed (turkey will most likely release some liquid onto pan). Line baking sheet with 3 layers of foil and set rack back inside. Place turkey, breast side up, on rack and
              tuck wings underneath. Let turkey sit at room temperature for around 3 hours.
              Place an oven rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450. Using your fingers, loosen skin on breast. Work 4 Tbsp. butter under skin, spreading evenly over both breasts. Smear outside of turkey with another 4 Tbsp. butter.
              Tie legs together with kitchen twine and pour 1 cup water into baking sheet.Roast turkey, rotating pan halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown all over, about 30 minutes.
              Meanwhile, cook vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, garlic, orange zest, and remaining 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbling and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest
              setting and keep glaze warm.
              Reduce oven temperature to 300 and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 30 minutes and adding more water by ½-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
              thickest part of breast near the neck registers 150 (don't worry; the temperature will continue to climb while the bird rests), 65-85 minutes longer. Skin should be deep golden brown, shiny, and crisp. Transfer turkey to a cutting
              board and let rest at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before carving.

            <h3>Melt butter in 4-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook celery and onion in butter 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Remove Dutch oven from the heat.
              Gently toss celery mixture and remaining ingredients, using spoon, until bread cubes are evenly coated.
              Use to stuff one 10- to 12-pound turkey. Or to bake stuffing separately, grease 3-quart casserole or rectangular baking dish, 13x9x2 inches. Place stuffing in casserole or baking dish. Cover with lid or aluminum foil and bake at
              325°F for 30 minutes; uncover and bake 15 minutes longer.</h3>
